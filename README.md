# Social Networking Application

I am excited to present my semester project, a GUI-based Social Networking Application developed in C++ using the QT framework. This application provides a platform for users to connect and interact, similar to popular social networks like Facebook and Instagram. However, it is uniquely designed to focus solely on text-based posts, with additional features to enhance user engagement and experience.

## Features

- *Share Post:* Users can share text-based posts to keep their connections updated with the latest happenings in their lives.
- *Share Activity:* This feature allows users to share their current activities, feelings, and achievements with others.
- *Share Memory:* Users can revisit and share past posts as memories, fostering a sense of nostalgia and continuity.
- *Like and Comment:* Engage with the community by liking and commenting on other users' posts.
- *Create a Page:* Each user has the capability to create a personal page to share posts and other content.
- *Follow and Befriend:* Users can follow pages of interest and add other users as friends. Friendships are private and visible only to the user on their profile and page.
- *Home Page:* The home page displays the latest posts from friends and followed pages in chronological order, ensuring that users stay updated with the most recent content.
- *Search Users:* An extensive search feature allows users to easily find and navigate to the profiles of other users and pages on the platform.

## How to Run?

### Ready-to-Use Application

- *Application Folder:* There is a folder named 'Application' in this repository. You can download it directly to use the Social Networking Application without any additional setup.

### Code and Customization

- *QT Tool:* To modify or extend the code, you need to have the QT framework installed on your system. You can download it from the [QT Download Page](https://www.qt.io/download-dev).

This project represents a significant step in my journey to mastering object-oriented programming and software development. I have put a great deal of effort into creating a functional and user-friendly application that highlights the core features of a social networking platform while maintaining a focus on text-based interactions.

I look forward to receiving feedback and suggestions to further enhance the application. Thank you for your support and interest in my project.
